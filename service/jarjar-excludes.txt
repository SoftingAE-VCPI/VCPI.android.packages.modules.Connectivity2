# Classes loaded by SystemServer via their hardcoded name, so they can't be jarjared
com\.android\.server\.ConnectivityServiceInitializer(\$.+)?
com\.android\.server\.NetworkStatsServiceInitializer(\$.+)?

# Do not jarjar com.android.server, as several unit tests fail because they lose
# package-private visibility between jarjared and non-jarjared classes.
# TODO: fix the tests and also jarjar com.android.server, or at least only exclude a package that
# is specific to the module like com.android.server.connectivity
